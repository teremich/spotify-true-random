# Spotify true random (str)
is a program written in JavaScript to be executed by node.js.
You will be able to choose a playlist to listen to, then str will send API requests to make the song queue truely random.
I have noticed that some songs are more likely to play than others with Spotify's native random shuffle.
This will fix that issue and allow for a truely pseudo-random experience.
